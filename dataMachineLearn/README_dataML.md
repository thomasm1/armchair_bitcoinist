1989- 1998: Convuluted Network, ; MNist; LSTM; Bidirectional RNN
2006: ImageNet
2012: AlexNet--AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network ---open
2014: GANS --Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are deep neural net architectures comprised of two nets, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”).

#### 1.Recurrent nets can model sequential data bc the hidden state is affected by the input AND previous hidden state.
#### 2.Solution to vanishing gradient problem is to use LSTM cells to remember long-term dependencies
#### 3.Use LSTM networks to make predictions for time-series data using TensorFlow/Keras
