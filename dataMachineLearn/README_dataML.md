### MACHINE LEARNING STRATEGY 

#### 1.Recurrent nets can model sequential data bc the hidden state is affected by the input AND previous hidden state.
#### 2.Solution to vanishing gradient problem is to use LSTM cells to remember long-term dependencies
#### 3.Use LSTM networks to make predictions for time-series data using TensorFlow/Keras
